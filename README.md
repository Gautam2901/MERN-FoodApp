Project Summary:

  Introduction

  As part of my web development training, I built a food delivery application using React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. The app offers features such as secure authentication, a dynamic menu, customizable    cart options, and Stripe payment integration, providing a practical solution for modern food delivery.

  Technologies Used:

  Node.js: A server-side runtime environment that powers the app, handling requests and managing multiple users efficiently.
  Express.js: A framework for building server routes and APIs, managing user authentication, product selection, and orders.
  MongoDB: A NoSQL database storing user data, product details, and orders in real-time, ensuring instant updates.
  React.js: A JavaScript library for building a responsive user interface, handling the frontend logic for sign-ups, product displays, and cart management.

  Key Features:

  User Authentication: Secure sign-ups and sign-ins, with token-based authentication for managing user sessions.
  Dynamic Menu: A React-based menu that allows users to explore products by category and interact with them in real-time.
  Cart Management: Users can add, update, or remove products from their cart, with real-time updates handled by MongoDB.
  Checkout and Payment: Users review their cart, add delivery details, and proceed to secure payment via Stripe.

  Summary:

  This project showcases my skills in integrating React.js for a smooth UI, Node.js and Express.js for server-side logic, and MongoDB for real-time data handling, with a complete flow from user authentication to    payment.
